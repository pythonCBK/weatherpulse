Weather Pulse is simple tool for your PC which sends weather summary as an notification. App sends notification about the weather conditions in choosen city every hour. You also can configure the temperature format. I'm planning to add some more functions and work on the UI in the future. If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to write them!

This app does not have compiled version, only source code. If you want to use it you need to create OpenweatherAPI account and get your API key which you need to put in the code.

üìÉ**Source code**

If you want to use source code (uncompiled file) you need to install some modules:
1. tkinter
2. plyer

Here is a command to install them all!

```pip install tkinter plyer```

You also need to get API-key from Openweather website and put it in the code!

‚ö†Ô∏è**Attention**

App doesn't safe any personal data and just uses OpenWeather API to get information about weather. There are also some little bugs which I will try to fix in the future!
